HMGR0001I=The HA Manager communication transport has been started. The number of Members shown does not represent the number of Members in the view but, rather, it shows the number of Members defined in this core group's corestack
HMGR0049E=Two policy definitions with the same name were found. This is not allowed. Assign unique names to the policies.
HMGR0129I=A user-requested activity has been performed. Details are provided in the log entry. 
HMGR0152W=There are too many runnable threads on the machine. Threads are not being dispatched in a timely manner. This will affect system stability. This situation can be caused by high CPU conditions, scenarios with large amounts of IO wait time on the CPU, and scenarios in which native memory is in short supply for the JVM.
HMGR0226I=The default value has been overriden by using a custom property. For a list of properties that can be set, visit the Info Center for the WAS version in use and search for "Core group custom properties".

DCSV0004W=DCS check discovered that it did not get CPU time slice for a long period of time. Check for OutOfMemory conditions or the generation of dumps (heap or otherwise) at this time. It is likely that the system experienced high CPU or that file IO caused the CPU to wait. 
DCSV0005I=The DCS stack named has started successfully on the Member specified in the entry. Additional information like build date and protocol are displayed.
DCSV0009W=Unreadable message received from another member. This might indicate incompatible software version. Check the version details on the Member that sent the malformed message. It is not advisable to have multiple stack versions running together.

DCSV1011W=DCS failed to join a multicast group address. A possible cause for this problem is a configured system limit on the maximal number of multicast groups.  Check network/firewall configuration of the operating system. 
DCSV1032I=The DCS system received a new connection, which was initiated by the defined member specified in the entry.
DCSV1033I=The DCS stack named has coalesced all members successfully into a single view (This was determined because all new view members sent a notification to this member using the new view identifier). The information inside the parenthesis details the current view indentifier and current coordinator. Also,the View channel type is displayed.
DCSV1036W=An unexpected network connectivity state has occurred. The situation may be recovered automatically.

DCSV1051W=The DCS outgoing messages queue exceeded its allocated memory limit. Further outgoing messages will be blocked. If message repeats, consider decreasing load on this process or increasing total memory available for DCS. For more information see the Information Center on configuring a core group for replication.
DCSV1052W=The DCS outgoing messages queue is close to exceed its allocated memory limit. If message repeats, consider decreasing load on this process or increasing total memory available for DCS.  For more information see the Information Center on configuring a core group for replication.
DCSV1053I=The DCS outgoing messages queue is back to its normal limit. This is printed after either DCSV1003W or DCSV1004W.
DCSV1054W=The transport infrastructure incoming messages memory exceeds its nominal memory limit. Consider increasing the nominal memory size in the transport configuration or lowering the load of the specified sender.  For more information see the Information Center on configuring a core group for replication.
DCSV1071E=An inconsistent internal state was detected in the transport infrastructure. See the exception for more information about the root cause of the problem. Correct the cause of the problem or contact IBM Support. 
DCSV1055I=The incoming message queue is back to its normal limit. This is printed after DCSV1011W.
DCSV1111W=Another member closed its outgoing connection to the local member. The other member may have been stopped, or there may be a problem with the member or with network connectivity. If the member has not been stopped, check the other member for errors and check network connectivity to other member. The suspected Member with problems is displayed in this entry.
DCSV1112W=DCS failed to receive a heartbeat from another member within a configured time interval. This may indicate a problem with the other member or with network connectivity. Check the other member for errors and check network connectivity to other member.
DCSV1113W=The outgoing connection to another member was closed. The other member may have been stopped, or there is a problem with the other member or with network connectivity. If the other member has not been stopped, check the other member for errors and check network connectivity to other member. The suspected Member with problems is displayed in this entry.
DCSV2004I=The DCS view synchronization for the named core group has completed successfully. The information inside the parenthesis details the current view indentifier.
DCSV8030I=Join attempt halted due to the specified reason.  This may be caused by high loads on the involved nodes. Can result in asymmetric views and instability for components with dependent HA managed items.
DCSV8053I=Internal view change protocol in process, with failed members being excluded. The failed members are listed in this entry. Review the log output on the server(s) displayed to determine why it/they has/have been excluded.
DCSV8054I=An internal view change protocol in process for the named core group at the Member specified.
DCSV8104W=The member is being removed due to request by another member. No action required. Check the removed member and/or the communication between the removed member and the requesting member.

DCSV8022I=The two members have different coregroup memberships. The inconsistency may be fixed automatically. Verify that the configuration has been synchronized across all the nodes in the cell. If not, manually synchronize the configuration. Once the configuration stabilizes, this problem should resolve itself automatically
DCSV8050I=The DCS stack named has completed a view change. The information inside the parenthesis details the current view indentifier. The current view size is also displayed. The extended data for the view is listed on this line as well. (AV = Number of Members available in the view, CD = Number of Members connected minus the number of Members denied from the view due to problems in connecting them, CN = Number of Members connected to the this process, DF = Number of Members defined to be present in this view {determined in WAS configuration}).
DCSV8054I=The DCS stack named has begun an internal view change.
DCSV8051I=The DCS stack named has changed the membership set (a Member was added to the view set).

CWRCB0108I=The core group bridge service has detected instability in the access point group named in the message. This indicates that there were changes in the core group bridge topology (I.e bridges entering or leaving the view)
CWRCB0124I=Details the size of the state data that the core group bridge service received from remote core groups by way of remote bridges.
